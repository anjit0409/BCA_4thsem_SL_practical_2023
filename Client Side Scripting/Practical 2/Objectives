Questions for Practical:

Q.1 Suppose you're developing a website that sells products online. You need to implement a feature that 
    applies discounts to products based on the user's membership level. 
    Here are the membership levels and the discounts associated with them:
        Basic: 5% off
        Premium: 10% off
        Gold: 15% off
    Write a JavaScript code that takes two parameters: the product price and the user's membership level. 
    The function should calculate the discounted price based on the membership level and return it. 
    If the membership level is not one of the three specified levels, the function should return the original price without any discount.


Q.2 Write a JavaScript code that takes an array of integers as a parameter, uses a loop to iterate over the array, 
    and returns the sum of all even integers in the array.
